A toy OS for RISC-V.

I know it's worthless to make an operating system for a specific architecture, but this project is for myself to learn RISC-V and operating systems. It's being developed with QEMU for now but will be, if possible, ported to MangoPi MQ-Pro - a cute pink SoC. I will try to make it as UNIX as I can, and POSIX-compatible hopefully.
